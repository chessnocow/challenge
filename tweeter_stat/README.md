# Task
Create a proof-of-concept for a tool that allows the user to specify a search term and receive every five seconds an updated output of some metrics about tweets that contain the search term.

The specific insights the tool should provide in its output are:
- What is the total count of tweets matching the search term seen so far?
- How many tweets containing the search term were there in the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes?
- What are the ten most frequent terms (excluding the search term) that appear in tweets containing the search term over the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes?
- Within tweets matching the search term, who were the top ten tweeps (Twitter users) who tweeted the most in the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes?
- What is the sentiment of tweets matching the search term over the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes?

This is not intended to be a fully production ready application. We are not expecting any fancy gui - command line is fine, or the ability to change the search term after the application is started. Also we are not expecting you to create your own sentiment algorithm, there are plenty of open source libraries that are good enough for this proof of concept. You will need to set up a Twitter developer account if you donâ€™t have one already.
